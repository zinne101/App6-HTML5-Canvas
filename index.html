Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to add a canvas to the page as well as buttons that function to add either a drawing, text, or an image to the canvas. 

Known Issues:
An issue encountered when creating this code was remaining consistant with varibles and formatting. It was also kind of challenge creating a code to clear the canvas when a button was clicked.
